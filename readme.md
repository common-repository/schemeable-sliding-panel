# Schemeable Sliding Panel
Use smooth and beautiful sliding panel for your blog. Fully scheme-able and configurable. Bundled with six beautiful schemes.

## Description

The Schemeable Sliding Panel plugin adds a smooth sliding panel to your blog. The panel can be fully configured through the 'Sliding Panel Options' menu page.

Features:

* 3 different ways of displaying the panel - Overlay over content, slide down or fixed
* Modify all aspects of the panel - fonts, colors, background images, text displayed etc.
* Use the panel for login/registration
* Display either a dashboard or static content for logged-in users
* Disable admin bar and standard login/register and lost password pages. This may help reducing spam-bot registrations.
* Save color schemes and export them as plugins that can be shared with others
* Use a static dashboard for both logged-in and logged-out users.
* Gain fine grained control by including your own CSS (and images)
* Integrates nicely with Wordpress Social Login.

This plugin is developed using [WpPDE Pro](http://wp-pde.jaliansystems.com "WpPDE Home") - a Plugin Development Environment for Wordpress Plugins.

This plugin is based on the awesome (though a bit dated) panel from [http://web-kreation.com/all/implement-a-nice-clean-jquery-sliding-panel-in-wordpress-27/](http://web-kreation.com/all/implement-a-nice-clean-jquery-sliding-panel-in-wordpress-27/ "Implement a Nice & Clean jQuery Sliding Panel in WordPress 2.7+"). Quite a bit of refactoring is done to include scheme modification functionality.

# Installation

Upload the Schemeable Sliding Panel plugin to your blog, activate it and modify the settings.
